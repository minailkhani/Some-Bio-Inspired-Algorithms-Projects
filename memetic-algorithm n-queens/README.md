**N Queens puzzle** is the problem of placing n chess queens on an n Ã— n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

A **memetic algorithm (MA)** in computer science and operations research, is an extension of the traditional genetic algorithm. It may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem. It uses a local search technique to reduce the likelihood of premature convergence.
