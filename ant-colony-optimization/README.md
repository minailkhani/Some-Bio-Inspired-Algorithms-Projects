Assignment problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem. In its most general form, the problem is as follows:
The problem instance has n agents and n tasks. Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform as many tasks as possible by assigning at most one agent to each task and at most one task to each agent, in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.


Each test case only contains an n Ã— n matrix M , which Mi,j represents the cost of assigning the i th task to the j th agent. The goal is to minimize the summation of the costs of assignments whilst not leaving any job undone.
