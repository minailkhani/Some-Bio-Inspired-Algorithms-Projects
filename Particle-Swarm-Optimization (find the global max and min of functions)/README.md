# Particle Swarm Optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution. PSO can be used to find the global minimum and maximum of sophisticated functions.



# problem :
find the global maximum and minimum of f and g, respectively
